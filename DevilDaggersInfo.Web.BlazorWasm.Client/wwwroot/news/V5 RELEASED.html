<p class="py-2">
	DevilDaggers.info version 5 has been released! This is probably the biggest milestone the project has ever had and I'm very happy about it. After 6 months of working on V5, it is finally time to replace the V4 website (which ran from mid 2018 to early 2022) with newer and better technology.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
	Almost every feature has been ported to the new website. I'll port the remaining small features soon. This weekend I'll be focusing on getting everything up and running, cleaning up all the old stuff, and fixing any potential issues.

<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Changes</h3>

<p class="py-2">
	The URL formats have been updated. Most URLs should redirect properly, including all the main pages, and all individual pages for players, spawnsets, custom leaderboards, and mods. Anything else might not redirect (and is probably not important).
