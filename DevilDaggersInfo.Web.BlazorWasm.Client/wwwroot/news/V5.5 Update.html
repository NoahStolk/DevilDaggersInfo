<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Global Custom Leaderboards</h3>
<ul class="py-2 pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">Added global custom leaderboards which combines every leaderboard in a category into a global leaderboard.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">The global shows the amount of daggers per player, as well as a scoring system which is based on the daggers and ranking.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Custom Leaderboard Score API V2</h3>
<ul class="py-2 pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">Improved performance for score submissions.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Replay files are now validated upon submit.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Fixed saving incorrect homing stored value upon submit.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Fixed replay submissions being able to override highscore by a very small amount.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Fixed not always sorting scores by submit date when two scores had equal times.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Replay Parsing</h3>
<ul class="py-2 pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">Implemented new library that is able to parse (local) replay files, as well as build replay files from scratch. These features can be used for analyzing gameplay, or possibly for writing a TAS for a certain spawnset.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Most of the events have been figured out, but not all is known yet (unknown values are named A, B, C, etc).</li>
	<li class="list-disc">The parsing feature can be tried out when viewing a custom leaderboard score. It parses the replay and displays all individual events on the page. See <a class="link" href="https://devildaggers.info/replay-parser/1">here</a> for an example.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Maybe I'll make a new tool called DevilDaggersReplayEditor some time in the future, who knows...</li>
</ul>
