				<b>IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!</b>
				<br />
				<p>
					This is the fifth (unreleased) version of DevilDaggers.info. It is currently in an ALPHA state. There are bugs. I will fix them. Some pages and features are missing. I will add them. Please do not go apeshit. You're probably not meant to be here unless I specifically linked this to you anyway.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also keep in mind that this subdomain uses the same database as the current version of the website, but NOT the same file system. There will be a discrepancy in data that's being shown. This will obviously be resolved once V5 supersedes V4.
