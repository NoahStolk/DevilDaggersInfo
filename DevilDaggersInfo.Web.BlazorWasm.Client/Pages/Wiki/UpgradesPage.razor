<p>
	There are 4 different types of hand upgrades in Devil Daggers. You unlock the first two upgrades by collecting gems, and the last one by collecting homing daggers.
</p>
<p>
	Each upgrades makes the player significantly more powerful by increasing the amount of daggers fired. Level 3 and Level 4 also enable homing daggers. Upgrades do not make the dagger jumps higher or increase shot speed.
