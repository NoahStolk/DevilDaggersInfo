<Heading Title="How To Use Spawnsets" />

<Paragraph>
	A spawnset (also known as a 'survival' file) is a file that mainly consists of a set of enemy spawns and the shape of the arena. It can be used for practicing the main game.
</Paragraph>

<Heading Level="2" Title="How do I play a custom spawnset?" />

<ol class="pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">Download a spawnset you want to play. Spawnsets can be found <a class="link" href="/custom/spawnsets">on this page</a>.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Navigate to the <span class="text-color-path">mods</span> folder where Devil Daggers is installed. On Windows, this is <span class="text-color-path">C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\devildaggers\mods</span> by default if you are using Steam. In this folder, there should be a file named <span class="text-color-path">put mods here.txt</span>.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Place the downloaded spawnset file in the <span class="text-color-path">mods</span> folder.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Rename the downloaded spawnset file to <span class="text-color-path">survival</span>.</li>
</ol>

<Paragraph>
	You can also use the <a class="link" href="/tools/survival-editor">Devil Daggers Survival Editor</a> to replace spawnsets:
</Paragraph>

<ol class="pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">Press CTRL I to open the list of spawnsets from the website in the editor.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Click on the spawnset you want to play.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Select "Yes" when the editor asks if you want to replace the currently active custom spawnset with the downloaded one. If it doesn't (this depends on your settings), press CTRL R to replace the file.</li>
</ol>

<Paragraph>
	You can now play the custom spawnset. The custom spawnset is reloaded every time you restart a run, or grab the dagger in the lobby. There is no need to restart the game when changing the spawnset.
