New site, everything is new, go check it out.

Here are the most important changes:

NEW

- Added accuracy stats to the leaderboard.
- Removed smooth scroll.
- Added gradient to the leaderboard.
- Leaderboard entries are now permanently given a "banned", "donator", or "admin :Kappa:" flag. No more automatic bans. (Thanks VHS.)
- Combined Spawnsets and Spawnsets Info pages.

If you haven't noticed, we have a bot now as well: @LeaderboardBot created by VHS
