<div class="faq-question">How do I participate?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
	You will need the <a asp-page="/Tools/DevilDaggersCustomLeaderboards">Devil Daggers Custom Leaderboards program</a>.<br />
</div>

<div class="faq-question">How does it work?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
	The program constantly scans the 'dd.exe' process for certain values stored in memory.<br />
	It can detect a bunch of values, as well as which spawnset you're playing.<br />
	When the player dies, it uploads those values to a leaderboard on DevilDaggers.info.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">How do I get my spawnset a leaderboard?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
	If you think your spawnset should have a leaderboard, let us know on <a href="@RazorUtils.DiscordUrl">Discord</a>.
