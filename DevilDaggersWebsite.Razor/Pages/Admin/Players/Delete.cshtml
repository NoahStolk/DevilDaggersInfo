<h1>Delete</h1>

<h2>Are you sure you want to delete this?</h2>
<div class="delete-warning">
	I prefer to not delete players at all, because it's not necessary. If someone wants their flag gone just set the Flag field to empty, if someone wants their settings gone just set the Dpi field to empty.<br /><br />
	Keep in mind that deleting a player also permanently deletes the custom leaderboard scores, spawnsets, and mods linked to them.<br /><br />
	The only reason why you might want to delete a player is when you've just created a new player and entered an incorrect Id.
