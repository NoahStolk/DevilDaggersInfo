<h1>Delete</h1>

<h2>Are you sure you want to delete this?</h2>
<div class="delete-warning">
	I prefer to not delete any spawnsets (no matter how bad they are) unless the author specifically says they want them removed from the site.<br /><br />
	Note that when you're deleting a spawnset, the associated custom leaderboard will also be deleted, including all of its scores.<br /><br />
	Offensive stuff can be permanently deleted such as a swastika arena or bad messages written on it.<br /><br />
	Don't forget to delete the actual file as well.
