This spawnset is mainly made for fun and for all skill level of players. You meet all spawnset waves by 126 seconds into the game.<br>After 126 seconds have passed the spawnset enters into the loop consisting of 3 spawns.<br>A Squid I, Squid II, and Squid I again. Sounds simple until you realise that the waves speed up with every passing wave.<br><br>Sequels will be made, v2 and v3 will happen, eventually.<br><br>Made with <a href='https://github.com/bowsr/DDSE'>bowsr's spawnset editor</a>
