This file is for practice. It gives you 175 gems (3 Centipedes, 2 Gigapedes), then puts you in the 3 Gigapede section of the game with accurate arena size. 175 gems is a reasonable amount to expect with a decent farm and good collection (e.g. where you start killing squids at ~80 seconds)<br><br>Checking the timer during this section can be very helpful, custom spawnsets won't accurately reflect that though.<br>In this spawnset:<ul><li>Gigapedes emerge at 80 seconds (normally 260)</li><li>Stop shooting to collect gems at 95 (normally 275)</li><li>Stop shooting to collect gems at 110 (normally 290)</li><li>Leviathan will spawn at 170 (normally 350)</li><li>Try to clear everything by then!</li></ul><br>Made with <a href='https://github.com/bowsr/DDSE'>bowsr's spawnset editor</a><br>I made a Leviathan practice file too: <a href='/Home/Spawnset/275GemsLeviPractice_Bintr'>275GemsLeviPractice</a>
