	"Description": "Imagine if Ghostpedes spawned at an initial rate of 1 per 2s, but that just sped up. The most difficult of the '<a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=Screaming_Stop'>Screaming</a>' spawnsets.<br>It's basically made so that you always die before your graphics card can combust.<br>But hey if you survive long enough to experience game-crushing lag you should probably hit 'r' before something weird happens."
