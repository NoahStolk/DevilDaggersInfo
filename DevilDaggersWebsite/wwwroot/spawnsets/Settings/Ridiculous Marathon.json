{	"Description": "No Loop. An hour-long Spawnset closely based on the '<a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=Absolutely Ridiculous Marathon_Stop'>Absolutely Ridiculous Marathon</a>' of the same map but fewer enemies making it 0.715x the difficulty of its predecessor; number based on file size & gem number ratios.<br><b><u>NB: Playing a replay beyond 2447s crashes the game.</u></b><br>Streaming should work because it's not watching the replay."}
