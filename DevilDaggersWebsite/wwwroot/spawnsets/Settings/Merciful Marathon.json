	"Description": "No loop. Lasts an hour.<br />The easiest version of 'The Marathon' in its 60minute form.<br />Definitely possible.<br /><br />Goes out with a bang but you should have more than enough homing daggers to survive the biggest wave at the 60-minute mark.<br />Compared with the 'Absolutely Ridiculous Marathon' (that was never intended to be possible) it's 64% as difficult, 'Ridiculous Marathon' is 72%; based on file size anyway. <br />Many minor alterations have been made from the 400s mark.<br /><br />Side note: This time the replay crashed around 2800s - it seems to vary."
