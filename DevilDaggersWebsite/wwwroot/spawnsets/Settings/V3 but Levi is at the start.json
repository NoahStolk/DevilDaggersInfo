	"Description": "It's exactly that - Leviathan's spawn-time has been moved to 0s, though absolutely no other changes have been made to spawns to try and make it easier.<br>So expect to almost always die shortly beyond 229s... unless you somehow tear away and pull off something otherworldly. Getting to Level 3 is intense. Not even nearly managed Level 4.<br>Harder than '<a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=V3 but it really isn&#39;t_Stop'>V3 but it really isn't</a>'. Also the reason I stretched out times in '<a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=V3 but it really isn&#39;t_Stop'>V3 but it really isn't</a>' - beating Leviathan is practically impossible otherwise."
