	"Description": "Gives <i>significantly</i> less time between each Endloop wave. Much more intense.<br />This way, you have no chance of taking a breather between waves and the waves will instantly merge into one. <br />Gem collection during the Endloop is much more dangerous on this map. All spawns are otherwise unaltered.<br />2000s worth of killing demons while trying to balance homing dagger use to stockpile as many homing as possible, followed by a vicious loop where you can only spray and pray with your homing daggers should you have survived that long. <br />Many sections are pretty much for homing dagger gathering but are broken up by other waves in between. Getting to the Endloop is possible. Though the homing daggers needed to survive multiple Endloop waves might be obtained by that point, using them properly to survive even the first Endloop wave is critical.<br />As time progresses, the requirement to use homing daggers generally increases. The end is made to be a pretty much endless wave of madness that requires at least near-constant homing dagger use to survive. A successful run's death is signaled when your homing daggers run out though because Hell will quickly turn otherworldly and mercilessly kill you."
