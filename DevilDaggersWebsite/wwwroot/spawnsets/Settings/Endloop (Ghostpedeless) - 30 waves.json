	"Description": "30 waves of the endgame loop but made so that no Ghostpedes are able to spawn, all spawns occur at the same speed as normal V3.<br>Forwards forecasting was used to estimate the enemy spawn times between waves 25 and 30. This is the no handicaps, get me in ASA type. Ends after 30 waves at 796s, though NO homing daggers are provided for this run so the run starts <u>much</u> earlier at 70s <i>(waves 1-30 occur over 726s; waves 20-30 span 137s, 2.76x faster than waves 1-10).</i>"
