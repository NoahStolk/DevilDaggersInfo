	"Description": "Ends shortly after 10 minutes.<br />Relatively difficult throughout; very difficult near the end.<br /><br />A map that only starts to noticeably shrink once you're getting near Leviathan. Seems to shrink rapidly and obviously after that point.<br />Enemy spawns come in droves of all at once of the same enemy.<br />Once Squid I and Squid II are out of the way, a single one of each spawns in all subsequent waves until the boss.<br /><br />A few things to remember: <br /><ul><li>The thorn stage has many more enemies than usual.</li><li>Leviathan is easier. Squid I's remain unchanged occurring 5 seconds after tangible spawning. The gap between Squid I's and Squid II's is doubled. The gap between Squid II's and the squid III is 2.5x longer than usual. After this, no spawns match those made by Sorath - The Orb is easier too.</li><li>Also, if you want level 3 before the centipedes you'll have to collect every gem you can get and balance killing squids and skulls - focusing on squids does not allow you to gain this upgrade so early.</li></ul>"
