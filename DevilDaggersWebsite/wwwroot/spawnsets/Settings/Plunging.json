	"Description": "Use double dagger jumps to cross 5 large gaps and reach the finishing platform. Missing landings means entering the abyss.<br />NB: While climbing back up, there are always 9 blocks to jump onto from the 3 available to land on. Only dagger jumps let you climb.<br />May cause audio issues that require restarting the game.<br /><br />Tip: Double dagger/shotgun jumps require you to only shoot a shotgun for the second jump: you cannot press space at the same time or it will not work. Easy to forget. If you want to practice in the light just walk forward and land on the first arrow to check your timing is right."
