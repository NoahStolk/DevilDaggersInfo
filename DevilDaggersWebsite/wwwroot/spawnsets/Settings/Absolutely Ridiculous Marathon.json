	"Description": "Might not even be physically possible. No loop. Lasts an hour.<br />Smaller map and over double the enemies to '<a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=The Marathon_Stop'>The Marathon</a>' - initially similar to '<a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=The Marathon_Stop'>The Marathon</a>'; drastically different towards the end. There are significantly less homing daggers available than for '<a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=The Marathon_Stop'>The Marathon</a>'.<br /><b><u>NB: Replays crash the game beyond 2447s.</u></b>"
