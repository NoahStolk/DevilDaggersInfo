	"Description": "This file is for practice. It gives you 275 gems (3 Centipedes, 4 Gigapedes), then puts you in the Leviathan section of the game with accurate arena size. 275 gems gives you the Level 4 hand (220 gems) and 55 spare homing. Normally, you can expect to have 120+ gems at Leviathan, but this section is perfectly doable with 55 and adding more Gigapedes to the beginning would get tedious.<br><br>If you're struggling with the Gigapedes in this file...<br>Try one of these spawnsets instead:<br><a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=Gigapedes_xvlv'>Gigapedes</a><br><a href='/Spawnset?spawnset=175Gems3GigapedesPractice_Bintr'>175Gems3GigapedesPractice</a><br>or watch my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR-O1xYgHk'>reference video</a><br><br>Made with <a href='https://github.com/bowsr/DDSE'>bowsr's spawnset editor</a>"
