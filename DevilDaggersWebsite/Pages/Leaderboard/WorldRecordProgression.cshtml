		This is the world record progression for Devil Daggers based on the <a asp-page="/Leaderboard/History">Leaderboard History</a> section of the website. While keeping track of any records after October 2018 has been fully automated, some older information is still missing. Most of the older information is based on screenshots and YouTube videos. If you find any information that's still missing, feel free to let me know. We have a specific channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/NF32j8S">Discord server</a> dedicated to finding old information.
