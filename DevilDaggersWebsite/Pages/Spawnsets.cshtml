	<h2>How to use spawnsets</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Select the spawnset you want to use and click the download button.</li>
		<li>Rename the file to "survival" (no quotes), the file should not have a file extension.</li>
		<li>
			Navigate to the directory where Devil Daggers is installed and open the folder named "dd".<br>
			By default, this is <span class="break-all" style="color: red;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\devildaggers\dd</span> on Windows.
		</li>
		<li>Replace the file called "survival" with the file you just downloaded.</li>
		<li>Launch Devil Daggers.</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>NOTE: You can replace the "survival" file while Devil Daggers is running. Just make sure to go back to the main menu before playing again, otherwise it won't change. The game reloads the file every time you grab the dagger in the lobby.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<div class="spawnsets-question">Can I get banned for using custom spawnsets?</div>
	<div class="spawnsets-answer">No, you can only get banned manually by the developer.</div>
	<div class="spawnsets-question">Can I override my real score using a custom spawnset?</div>
	<div class="spawnsets-answer">No, the game only uploads scores done with the original V3 spawnset.</div>
	<div class="spawnsets-question">The game doesn't submit my scores anymore even though I put the original survival file back in the dd folder. Why?</div>
	<div class="spawnsets-answer">It's always the safest to just reinstall the game completely whenever you want to play the real game again, as it might still not upload your scores even if you placed the original V3 spawnset back in the folder.<br />NOTE: This might be outdated. Just keep an eye out for the "score not submitted (error)" message. If you keep getting it even with the original file, reinstall the game.</div>

	<div class="spawnsets-answer">Yes, certainly. Send the files to <a href="mailto:@RazorExtensions.Email">@RazorExtensions.Email</a>, as well as the name of the spawnset and your name (author). Or just join the <a href="https://discord.gg/NF32j8S">Discord server</a> and send them there.</div>
